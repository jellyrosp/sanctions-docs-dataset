On 30 January 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree that awarded to Stroygazmontazh (Rotenberg’s company at the time), a State contract for the construction of the Kerch Bridge from Russia to the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Through these contracts he has financially benefited from Russian Decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea or the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. He was the owner of the company Stroygazmontazh until 2019, which has been awarded a State contract for the construction of the Kerch bridge from Russia to the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea, therefore consolidating its integration into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Similarly, in January 2017, Stroygazmontazh was awarded the State contract worth 17 billion roubles for the construction of a railway line on the Kerch bridge, which again further undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Other activities included being the the chairman of the board of directors of the publishing house Prosvescheniye until 2017, which has notably implemented the project ‘To the Children of Russia: Address- Crimea’, a public relations campaign that was designed to persuade Crimean children that they are now Russian citizens living in Russia, and thereby supporting the Russian Government's policy to integrate Crimea into Russia.

Kara-Murza was subsequently found guilty of three charges, including disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces under part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news” laws.  
 
POTYCHKO was also involved in the criminal proceedings against Ilya Yashin under the same law, and made public comment regarding preventing Yashin from expressing anti-war views to journalists during those proceedings. 
 
This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.

POTYCHKO’s involvement as part of the prosecution team in the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, her appearance on behalf of the prosecution to oppose the appeal against preventative detention, and her involvement in and statement regarding the proceedings against Yashin demonstrate that she  is an involved person because she is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
