Ilan Mironovich SHOR,male,"Ilan Shor is a Moldovan politician (leader of the ȘOR Political Party) and businessman from the Republic of Moldova who is involved in the illegal financing of political parties in the Republic of Moldova and in incitement to violence against the political opposition. Before being declared unconstitutional in June 2023, the ȘOR Party, which Ilan Shor leads, was involved in the payment and training of persons in order to provoke disorder and unrest during the protests in the Republic of Moldova.; By a decision dated 13 April 2023, the Court of Appeal of Chisinau sentenced Ilan Shor for being guilty of fraud and money laundering in the ‘Bank Fraud’ case to 15 years of imprisonment and the confiscation of assets for a value of EUR 254 million. Funds from this large-scale banking fraud and connections to corrupt oligarchs and Moscow-based entities have been and are still being used, according to authorities of the Republic of Moldova, to artificially create political unrest in the country.; His actions directed towards subverting democracy in the Republic of Moldova include providing illegal funding to support pro-Kremlin political activity in the Republic of Moldova. An example of the use of such funds is the organisation of violent protests and rallies, primarily in the capital Chisinau, with the help of protestors paid by the ȘOR Party, throughout 2022 and 2023. After the ȘOR Party was declared unconstitutional, Ilan Shor continued to facilitate Russian influence on the political scene of the Republic of Moldova by illegally financing other parties and attempting to bribe politicians.; By directing and planning violent demonstrations and through his serious financial misconduct concerning public funds and the unauthorised export of capital, Ilan Shor is responsible for actions which undermine and threaten the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Moldova, and the democracy, the rule of law, stability and security in the Republic of Moldova.",,,,,30-05-2023,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2023_888_28_April_2023,02023R0888-20241014,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/888/2024-10-14,Moldova,"Republic of Moldova, Israeli"
