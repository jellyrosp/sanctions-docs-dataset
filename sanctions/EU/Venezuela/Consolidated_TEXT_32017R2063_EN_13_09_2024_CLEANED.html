As a member of the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court, Indira Maira Alfonzo Izaguirre is responsible for the actions taken against the then newly elected National Assembly in December 2015, resulting in the impossibility for the National Assembly to exert its legislative power. Moreover, she accepted her appointment as the chairwoman of the CNE in June 2020 by the Supreme Court although this prerogative belongs to the National Assembly. In that role she prepared and supervised the non-democratic elections of the National Assembly held on 6&nbsp;December 2020 and participated in the change of 30&nbsp;June 2020 to the electoral norms for those elections, without formally leaving the Supreme Court (temporary permit to integrate the CNE). After the renewal of the CNE in May 2021, she returned to the Supreme Court. Her actions have therefore undermined democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela.</p>
