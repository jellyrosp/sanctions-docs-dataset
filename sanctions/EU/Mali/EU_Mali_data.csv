"DIAW, Malick",male,"Malick Diaw is a key member of Colonel Assimi Goïta’s inner circle. As chief of staff of the third military region of Kati, he was one of the instigators and leaders of the 18 August 2020 coup alongside Colonel-Major Ismaël Wagué, Colonel Assimi Goïta, Colonel Sadio Camara and Colonel Modibo Koné.; Malick Diaw is therefore responsible for actions or policies that threaten the peace, security and stability of Mali.; Malick Diaw is also a key actor in the context of the political transition of Mali, as President of the National Transition Council (CNT) since December 2020.; The CNT failed to deliver in good time on the ‘missions’ enshrined in the Transition Charter of 1 October 2020 (‘Transition Charter’) and that should have been completed within 18 months, as illustrated by the CNT's delay in adopting the draft electoral bill. That delay contributed to delaying the organization of the elections and thus the successful completion of the political transition of Mali. In addition, the new electoral bill, as eventually adopted by the CNT on 17 June 2022 and published in the Official Journal of the Republic of Mali on 24 June 2022, allows the Transition President and Vice-President and the members of the Transition Government to be candidates for the presidential and legislative elections, in contradiction with the Transition Charter.; The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) adopted individual sanctions against the Transition Authorities (including Malick Diaw) in November 2021 for their delay in organising the elections and the completion of the political transition of Mali. On 3 July 2022, ECOWAS decided to maintain those individual sanctions.; Malick Diaw is therefore obstructing and undermining the successful completion of the political transition of Mali.",,,,04-02-2022,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2017_1770_28_September_2017,02017R1770-20241214,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1770/2024-12-14,Mali,Malian

That situation obstructed the implementation of that Agreement, which was one of the ‘missions’ of the political transition of Mali, as provided for in Article 2 of the Transition Charter.; On 25 January 2024, the Transition Government denounced the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali and declared its immediate termination. Since that date, there has been a significant increase in the authoritarian constraints imposed by the Transition Government.; The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) adopted individual sanctions against the Transition Authorities (including Ismaël Wagué) in November 2021 for their delay in organising the elections and the completion of the political transition of Mali.

"MAÏGA, Choguel",male,"As Prime Minister from June 2021 to November 2024, Choguel Maïga led the Transition Government of Mali established following the coup of 24 May 2021.; Contrary to the timetable for reform and elections previously agreed with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in line with the Transition Charter, he announced in June 2021 the organisation of the National Consultations for Refoundation (Assises nationales de la refondation, ANR) as a pre-reform process and a precondition to the organisation of the elections scheduled for 27 February 2022.; As announced by Choguel Maïga, the ANR were then postponed several times and the elections delayed. The ANR, which were eventually held in December 2021, were boycotted by multiple stakeholders.

On 3 July 2022, ECOWAS decided to maintain those individual sanctions.; On 21 November 2024, Choguel Maïga was dismissed as Prime Minister by junta leader Colonel Assimi Goïta, following criticism by Choguel Maïga of the military junta.; As Prime Minister, Choguel Maïga was directly responsible for postponing the elections foreseen in the Transition Charter. Choguel Maïga was also directly responsible for the denunciation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, as well as for the authoritarian measures enacted by the Transition Government. Therefore, he has obstructed and undermined the successful completion of the political transition of Mali, in particular by obstructing and undermining the holding of elections and the handover of power to elected authorities.",,,,04-02-2022,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2017_1770_28_September_2017,02017R1770-20241214,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1770/2024-12-14,Mali,Malian
