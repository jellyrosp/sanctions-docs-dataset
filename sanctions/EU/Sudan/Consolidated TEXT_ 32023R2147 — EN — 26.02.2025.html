                        <p class="tbl-norm">Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed was the Sudanese Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Government of Omar al-Bashir. Following the fall of the al-Bashir regime, Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed was selected as one of the leaders of the Sudanese Islamist Movement (SIM) and led efforts to derail Sudan’s progress towards a&nbsp;full democratic transition, by undermining the former civilian-led transitional government and the Framework Political Agreement process. This contributed to the conflict between the SAF and RSF, which began on 15&nbsp;April 2023.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">He and other hardline Sudanese Islamists are actively obstructing efforts to reach a&nbsp;ceasefire to end the conflict and they are opposing civilian efforts to restore Sudan’s democratic transition. Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed is a&nbsp;stalwart of the National Congress Party (NCP), founded by Omar Al-Bashir in 1998. The NCP is the successor organisation to the Brotherhood-affiliated National Islamic Front.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed is currently the Secretary-General of the SIM, a&nbsp;broad alliance of Islamist groups, and is considered to be the man behind the NCP’s resurgence. The Islamist movement has a&nbsp;strong influence on the SAF, police and intelligence services.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">Therefore, Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed engages directly or indirectly in, provides support to, or benefits from, actions or policies that threaten the peace, stability or security of Sudan.</p>

Propaganda videos featuring Masar Abdurahman Aseel were published by the RSF in March and in April 2024, demonstrating his warmongering support to the RSF and his role in rallying the troops behind the RSF to join their fight against the SAF since 15&nbsp;April 2023.</p>
