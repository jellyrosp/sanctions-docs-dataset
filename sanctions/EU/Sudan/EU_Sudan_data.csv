EL TAHIR Mohamed EL AWAD EL AMIN,male,"El Tahir Mohamed El Awad El Amin is a Lieutenant General in the SAF and Commander of the Sudanese Air Force since 1 September 2022. He is therefore in charge of the operations carried out by the Air Force of the SAF since the outbreak of the conflict between the SAF, the RSF and their allied militias on 15 April 2023, as underscored by his participation in publicly disclosed high-level meetings of senior commanders of the SAF headed by the Commander-in-Chief Abdelfattah Al-Burhan in the General Command of the SAF in Khartoum in May and July 2023.; El Tahir Mohamed El Awad El Amin therefore holds a direct command responsibility in the indiscriminate aerial bombing carried out by the Air Force of the SAF in densely populated residential areas, notably in Khartoum, Omdurman, Nyala (South Darfur) and in North Kordofan, documented by the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) in its 31 August 2023 and 13 November 2023 reports to the Secretary-General, by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in its 22 February 2024 report and by the United Nations Panel of Experts on Sudan in its 15 January 2024 report.; El Tahir Mohamed El Awad El Amin has thus been engaged directly in the continuation of the Sudanese conflict, which threatens the peace, stability and security of Sudan, and has been involved in planning, directing and committing aerial operations which have resulted in serious human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law by causing high numbers of civilian casualties, leading to displacement of the civilian population and to the destruction of critical infrastructures, including medical facilities such as the East Nile Hospital in Khartoum in May 2023 and the Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital in El-Fasher in May 2024.",,,,24-06-2024,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2023_2147_9_October_2023,02023R2147-20250226,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2147/2025-02-26,Sudan,Sudanese
Ali Ahmed KARTI MOHAMED,male,"Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed was the Sudanese Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Government of Omar al-Bashir. Following the fall of the al-Bashir regime, Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed was selected as one of the leaders of the Sudanese Islamist Movement (SIM) and led efforts to derail Sudan’s progress towards a full democratic transition, by undermining the former civilian-led transitional government and the Framework Political Agreement process. This contributed to the conflict between the SAF and RSF, which began on 15 April 2023.; He and other hardline Sudanese Islamists are actively obstructing efforts to reach a ceasefire to end the conflict and they are opposing civilian efforts to restore Sudan’s democratic transition. Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed is a stalwart of the National Congress Party (NCP), founded by Omar Al-Bashir in 1998. The NCP is the successor organisation to the Brotherhood-affiliated National Islamic Front.; Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed is currently the Secretary-General of the SIM, a broad alliance of Islamist groups, and is considered to be the man behind the NCP’s resurgence. The Islamist movement has a strong influence on the SAF, police and intelligence services.; Therefore, Ali Ahmed Karti Mohamed engages directly or indirectly in, provides support to, or benefits from, actions or policies that threaten the peace, stability or security of Sudan.",,,,24-06-2024,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2023_2147_9_October_2023,02023R2147-20250226,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2147/2025-02-26,Sudan,Sudanese
Mustafa Ibrahim ABDEL NABI MOHAMED,male,"Mustafa Ibrahim Abdel Nabi Mohamed is a former senior official of the Sudanese Central Bank who became the RSF’s financial adviser, helping it to manage a web of proxy companies and entities.; A UN Panel of Experts Report on sanctions in Darfur recently referred to a former senior official of the Sudanese Central Bank who is based in Dubai and has become the RSF’s financial adviser without naming him. The report also explains that al Khaleej Bank became instrumental to the RSF’s financing in 2019 when its majority ownership was acquired by individuals and entities associated with the RSF.; Media reports and think-tanks have identified him as Mustafa Ibrahim Abdel Nabi Mohamed. He is a Director of Al Khaleej Bank, a Sudanese bank.; Over 60 % of the shares of Al Khaleej Bank are held by companies associated with the family of Mohammad Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), the head of the RSF.; Mustafa Ibrahim Abdel Nabi Mohamed is also the majority shareholder of Shield Protective Solutions Co. Ltd. The other shareholder in this company is one of the brothers of Hemedti, namely Musa Hamdan Dagalo Musa, and this company holds over 14 % of the shareholding in al Khaleej Bank.; As a financial adviser to the RSF and the Dagalo family, Mustafa Ibrahim Abdel Nabi Mohamed is engaging directly or indirectly in providing support to, or benefitting from, actions or policies that threaten the peace, stability or security of Sudan.",,,,24-06-2024,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2023_2147_9_October_2023,02023R2147-20250226,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2147/2025-02-26,Sudan,Sudanese
Masar Abdurahman ASEEL,male,"Masar Abdurahman Aseel is a prominent tribal leader of the Mahamid clan in West Darfur. The Mahamid clan belongs to the Rizeigat tribe which gathers Arab communities inhabiting Darfur and Chad. He holds the title of Amir and is a member of the Native Administration in West Darfur.; Masar Abdurahman Aseel has facilitated the attacks led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their allied militias against local communities living in El Geneina (West Darfur), especially the Massalit people, since April 2023. In particular, he directly contributed to the recruitment and arming of militias by the RSF and to the coordination between these forces, as is reported by the 15th final report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Sudan published in January 2024, to carry out their ethnically targeted attacks, notably against the Massalit communities, in West Darfur between late April and early November 2023. Propaganda videos featuring Masar Abdurahman Aseel were published by the RSF in March and in April 2024, demonstrating his warmongering support to the RSF and his role in rallying the troops behind the RSF to join their fight against the SAF since 15 April 2023.; Masar Abdurahman Aseel has therefore engaged directly in, provided support to and benefitted from actions and policies that threaten the peace, stability and security of Sudan. By supporting the seizing of West Darfur by the RSF, Masar Abdurahman Aseel has strengthened his position and influence within the Native Administration of West Darfur, at the expense of other community leaders, notably belonging to the Massalit community, which have been targeted by the RSF and their allied militias.",,,,24-06-2024,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2023_2147_9_October_2023,02023R2147-20250226,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2147/2025-02-26,Sudan,unknown
Salah Abdallah Mohamed SALAH,male,"Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah is the former national security advisor of the Republic of Sudan and the former Director of the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).; Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah is responsible for several coups d’état in Sudan – notably those in 2012 and 2019 – and helped in the execution of a coup d’état in 2021. He is widely considered to be Sudan’s spymaster. Due to his expertise as a former security official, he played a role in helping former regime elements to return to power and undermined efforts to establish a civilian government in Sudan.; After the fall of the Al-Bashir regime, Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah continues to be involved in activities that destabilise peace and stability in the country. Although he is rarely seen in public, he remains active and is considered to be the ‘mastermind’ behind many of the actions carried out by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the intelligence operations department as part of the ongoing crisis.; Therefore, Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah is considered to be a leader among the hardliner elements of the former Al-Bashir regime, who is responsible for security and military-related efforts and is embedded in the structures of the SAF. His ideological ties to the former Al-Bashir regime, and in particular to the National Congress Party (NCP) are a strong driver of the narrative that fuels the war against the opposing front, namely the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).; Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah has therefore been involved in actions that threaten the peace, stability or security of Sudan and in actions undermining the efforts to resume the political transition in Sudan.",,,,16-12-2024,COUNCIL_REGULATION_EU_2023_2147_9_October_2023,02023R2147-20250226,http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2147/2025-02-26,Sudan,Sudanese
