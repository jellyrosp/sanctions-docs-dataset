                        <p class="tbl-norm">Masar Abdurahman Aseel is a&nbsp;prominent tribal leader of the Mahamid clan in West Darfur. The Mahamid clan belongs to the Rizeigat tribe which gathers Arab communities inhabiting Darfur and Chad. He holds the title of Amir and is a&nbsp;member of the Native Administration in West Darfur.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">Masar Abdurahman Aseel has facilitated the attacks led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their allied militias against local communities living in El Geneina (West Darfur), especially the Massalit people, since April 2023. In particular, he directly contributed to the recruitment and arming of militias by the RSF and to the coordination between these forces, as is reported by the 15th final report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Sudan published in January 2024, to carry out their ethnically targeted attacks, notably against the Massalit communities, in West Darfur between late April and early November 2023. Propaganda videos featuring Masar Abdurahman Aseel were published by the RSF in March and in April 2024, demonstrating his warmongering support to the RSF and his role in rallying the troops behind the RSF to join their fight against the SAF since 15&nbsp;April 2023.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">Masar Abdurahman Aseel has therefore engaged directly in, provided support to and benefitted from actions and policies that threaten the peace, stability and security of Sudan. By supporting the seizing of West Darfur by the RSF, Masar Abdurahman Aseel has strengthened his position and influence within the Native Administration of West Darfur, at the expense of other community leaders, notably belonging to the Massalit community, which have been targeted by the RSF and their allied militias.</p>

                        <p class="tbl-norm">Therefore, Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah is considered to be a&nbsp;leader among the hardliner elements of the former Al-Bashir regime, who is responsible for security and military-related efforts and is embedded in the structures of the SAF. His ideological ties to the former Al-Bashir regime, and in particular to the National Congress Party (NCP) are a&nbsp;strong driver of the narrative that fuels the war against the opposing front, namely the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p>
