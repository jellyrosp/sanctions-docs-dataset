Furthermore, as former Minister of Defence, Mya Tun Oo bears responsibility for the attacks by the military forces in Kayah State on 25 December 2021 killing more than 30 people, including children and humanitarian staff, and mass killings and torture of civilians throughout Myanmar. In his previous role as Minister of Defence, General Mya Tun Oo was moreover responsible for the bombardments, air raids, and other instances of large-scale violence that have been carried out by the Myanmar armed forces during 2022. Therefore, he is responsible for serious human rights violations in Myanmar/Burma.; In 2018, the United Nations as well as international civil society organisations reported gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan States against the Rohingya population by the military and police forces since 2011 and concluded that many of those violations amount to the gravest crimes under international law. Mya Tun Oo was Joint Chief of Staff of the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw), the third most senior position in the Tatmadaw, from August 2016 until his appointment as Minister of Defence. In that capacity, he oversaw military operations carried out in Rakhine State and coordinated the various armed forces, including the Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as the use of artillery.
