He is Chairman of the State Administration Council (SAC) and member of the National Defence and Security Council (NDSC). Min Aung Hlaing declared himself as ‘Prime Minister’ on 1&nbsp;August 2021. On 1&nbsp;February 2021, the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup in Myanmar/Burma by setting aside the results of the elections held on 8&nbsp;November 2020 and by overthrowing the democratically elected government. As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a state of emergency on 1&nbsp;February 2021 and transferred the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. On 2&nbsp;February 2021, the SAC was established to exercise those powers, preventing the democratically elected government from fulfilling its mandate. On 31&nbsp;January 2022, upon the request of Min Aung Hlaing, the NDSC formally extended the state of emergency until 31&nbsp;July 2022.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">By concentrating all powers and as Chairman of the SAC, Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing has been directly involved in and responsible for decision-making concerning state functions and is therefore responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar/Burma. Additionally, the SAC adopted decisions restricting the rights to freedom of expression, including access to information, and peaceful assembly. The military forces and authorities operating under the control of the SAC have committed serious human rights violations since 1&nbsp;February 2021, killing civilian and unarmed protestors, restricting freedom of assembly and of expression, including by restricting internet access, and through arbitrary arrests and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup. As Chairman of the SAC, Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing is directly responsible for those repressive decisions and for serious human rights violations.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">In 2018, the UN as well as international civil society organisations reported gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan States against the Rohingya population by the military and police forces since 2011 and concluded that many of those violations amount to the gravest crimes under international law. As Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw since 2011, Min Aung Hlaing is directly responsible for those serious violations and abuses against the Rohingya population.</p>

Myint Swe then declared a state of emergency and handed over legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The procedure for declaring the state of emergency was breached as, under the Constitution, only the President has the authority to declare a state of emergency.

                        <p class="tbl-norm">Soe Win has been the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) since 2011. He is Vice-Chairman of the State Administration Council (SAC) and member of the National Defence and Security Council (NDSC). On 1&nbsp;February 2021, the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup in Myanmar by setting aside the results of the elections held on 8&nbsp;November 2020 and by overthrowing the democratically elected government. As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a state of emergency on 1&nbsp;February 2021 and transferred the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. On 2&nbsp;February 2021, the SAC was established to exercise those powers, preventing the democratically elected government from fulfilling its mandate. Soe Win participated in the meeting of the NDSC on 31&nbsp;January 2022, which extended the state of emergency until 31&nbsp;July 2022.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">As Vice-Chairman of the SAC, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win has been directly involved in and responsible for decision-making concerning state functions and is therefore responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar/Burma. Additionally, the SAC adopted decisions restricting the rights to freedom of expression, including access to information, and peaceful assembly. The military forces and authorities operating under the control of the SAC have committed serious human rights violations since 1&nbsp;February 2021, killing civilian and unarmed protestors, restricting freedom of assembly and of expression, including by restricting internet access, and through arbitrary arrests and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">As Vice-Chairman of the SAC, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win is directly responsible for those repressive decisions and for serious human rights violations.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">In 2018, the United Nations as well as international civil society organisations reported gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan States against the Rohingya population by the military and police forces since 2011 and concluded that many of those violations amount to the gravest crimes under international law. As Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw since 2011, Soe Win is responsible for those serious violations and abuses against the Rohingya population.</p>

As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a&nbsp;state of emergency on 1&nbsp;February 2021 and transferred the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the state to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Furthermore, the SAC has imposed martial law in parts of the country allowing the military complete authority over the specified areas, including administrative, judicial and law enforcement functions. In the areas under martial law, civilians, including journalists and peaceful protesters, are prosecuted by military courts, effectively depriving them of the right to due process, including the right to appeal.

Since the nominations of Chit Naing as Minister of Information and Zaw Min Tung as his deputy, the newspapers have been filled with pro-military articles. Hence, Zaw Min Tun bears responsibility for junta propaganda and spreading disinformation through state media that are not reporting accurately. He also bears responsibility for decisions that led to the crackdown on Myanmar media. This includes directives, which ordered independent media not to use ‘coup’, ‘military regime’ and ‘junta’, and which has seen local news outlets banned in the country and domestic and foreign journalists being arrested. In his statements, he publicly supports the military coup. He is therefore responsible for undermining democracy in Myanmar/Burma by limiting press freedom and access of information both on-line and off-line.</p>

As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a state of emergency on 1 February and transferred the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. On 2&nbsp;February 2021 the SAC was established to exercise those powers, preventing the democratically elected government from fulfilling its mandate.</p>

The military forces and authorities operating under the control of the SAC have restricted freedom of assembly and of expression by blocking internet access, and through arbitrary arrests, detentions and convictions of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup. Furthermore, the SAC has imposed martial law in parts of the country allowing the military to exercise full authority over the specified area, including administrative, judicial and law-enforcement functions. In the areas under martial law, civilians, including journalists and peaceful protesters, are prosecuted by military courts, deprived of the right to due process, including the right of appeal. Violent actions by military and police forces threatening peace, security and stability have increased significantly in areas where martial law has been declared.</p>
