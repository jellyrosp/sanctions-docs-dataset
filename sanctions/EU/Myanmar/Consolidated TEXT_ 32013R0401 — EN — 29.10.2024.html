                        <p class="tbl-norm">General Mya Tun Oo is a&nbsp;member of the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw). He was Minister of Defence from 1&nbsp;February 2021 to 3&nbsp;August 2023, and is a&nbsp;member of the State Administrative Council (SAC). On 1&nbsp;February 2023, he was also appointed Deputy Prime Minister. As of 1&nbsp;August 2023, he also assumed the role of Minister of Transport and Communications. He also oversees other junta-controlled supervisory bodies related to foreign investment and trade.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">On 1&nbsp;February 2021, the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a&nbsp;coup in Myanmar by setting aside the results of the elections held on 8&nbsp;November 2020 and by overthrowing the democratically elected government. As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a&nbsp;state of emergency on 1&nbsp;February 2021 and transferred the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the state to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. On 2&nbsp;February 2021, the SAC was established to exercise those powers, preventing the democratically elected government from fulfilling its mandate. Mya Tun Oo participated in the meeting of the National Defence and Security Council (NDSC) on 31&nbsp;January 2022, which extended the state of emergency until 31&nbsp;July 2022. As member of the NDSC and SAC, General Mya Tun Oo has been directly involved in and responsible for decision-making concerning state functions and is therefore responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar/Burma.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">Additionally, the SAC adopted decisions restricting the rights to freedom of expression, including access to information, and peaceful assembly. The military forces and authorities operating under the control of the SAC have committed serious human rights violations since 1&nbsp;February 2021, killing civilian and unarmed protestors, restricting freedom of assembly and of expression, including by restricting internet access, and through arbitrary arrests and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">As member of the SAC, General Mya Tun Oo is directly responsible for those repressive decisions and for serious human rights violations. Furthermore, as former Minister of Defence, Mya Tun Oo bears responsibility for the attacks by the military forces in Kayah State on 25&nbsp;December 2021 killing more than 30 people, including children and humanitarian staff, and mass killings and torture of civilians throughout Myanmar. In his previous role as Minister of Defence, General Mya Tun Oo was moreover responsible for the bombardments, air raids, and other instances of large-scale violence that have been carried out by the Myanmar armed forces during 2022. Therefore, he is responsible for serious human rights violations in Myanmar/Burma.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">In 2018, the United Nations as well as international civil society organisations reported gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan States against the Rohingya population by the military and police forces since 2011 and concluded that many of those violations amount to the gravest crimes under international law. Mya Tun Oo was Joint Chief of Staff of the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw), the third most senior position in the Tatmadaw, from August 2016 until his appointment as Minister of Defence. In that capacity, he oversaw military operations carried out in Rakhine State and coordinated the various armed forces, including the Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as the use of artillery. He is therefore responsible for those serious violations and abuses against the Rohingya population.</p>

Lieutenant General Moe Myint Tun served as Commander of the Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)-6 and was the Chief of Staff (Army) of the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) until 2019. In that capacity, he oversaw operations in Rakhine State. He is therefore responsible for those serious violations and abuses against the Rohingya population.</p>

In his previous roles as Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and Chief of Police, Lieutenant General Than Hlaing was directly responsible for decision making concerning repressive policies and violent actions committed by police against peaceful demonstrators and is therefore responsible for serious human rights violations in Myanmar/Burma.</p>

Furthermore, the SAC has imposed martial law in parts of the country allowing the military complete authority over the specified areas, including administrative, judicial and law enforcement functions. In the areas under martial law, civilians, including journalists and peaceful protesters, are prosecuted by military courts, effectively depriving them of the right to due process, including the right to appeal.

As Minister for Information, he was responsible for state-owned media (MWD, MRTV, Myanmar Alin, Kyemon and Global New Light of Myanmar newspapers, as well as the Myanmar News Agency (MNA) and Myanmar Digital News), and thus for the broadcasting and publication of official news. During his term as Minister for Information, the newspapers were filled with pro-military articles and he is therefore responsible for junta propaganda and spreading disinformation through state media that are not reporting accurately. He is directly responsible for decisions that led to the crackdown on Myanmar media. This includes directives, which ordered independent media not to use the words ‘coup’, ‘military regime’ and ‘junta’, and which has seen five local news outlets banned in the country.

                        <p class="tbl-norm">On 1&nbsp;February 2021, the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup in Myanmar by setting aside the results of the elections held on 8&nbsp;November 2020 and overthrowing the democratically elected government. As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a state of emergency on 1&nbsp;February 2021 transferring the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the state to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. On 2&nbsp;February 2021, the State Administration Council (SAC) was established to exercise those powers, preventing the democratically elected government from fulfilling its mandate. In July 2022, Oo took part in the case brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which she testified against the accusation of genocide of the Rohingya population and defended the junta.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">Thida Oo has been part of the government that emerged from the coup since its first day, using the power granted by the 2010 Attorney General of the Union Law to pursue politically motivated trials and subsequent arbitrary detention and to act as an enabling force for the abuses committed by the military regime. She is therefore engaged in actions and policies undermining democracy and the rule of law in&nbsp;Myanmar/Burma, as well as actions that threaten the peace, security and stability of&nbsp;Myanmar/Burma.</p>

                        <p class="tbl-norm">On 1&nbsp;February 2021 the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup in Myanmar/Burma by setting aside the results of the elections held on 8&nbsp;November 2020 and overthrowing the democratically elected government. As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a state of emergency on 1 February and transferred the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. On 2&nbsp;February 2021 the SAC was established to exercise those powers, preventing the democratically elected government from fulfilling its mandate.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">As a member of the SAC, U Shwe Kyein has been directly involved in and responsible for decision-making concerning State functions and is therefore responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar/Burma. Additionally, the SAC adopted decisions restricting the rights to freedom of expression, including access to information, and peaceful&nbsp;assembly.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">The military forces and authorities operating under the control of the SAC have continuously committed serious human rights violations since&nbsp;1&nbsp;February 2021, by killing civilian and unarmed protestors, displacing hundreds of thousands of people, burning, torturing and killing civilians and denying equal access to humanitarian aid. The military forces and authorities operating under the control of the SAC have restricted freedom of assembly and of expression by blocking internet access, and through arbitrary arrests, detentions and convictions of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup. Furthermore, the SAC has imposed martial law in parts of the country allowing the military to exercise full authority over the specified area, including administrative, judicial and law-enforcement functions. In the areas under martial law, civilians, including journalists and peaceful protesters, are prosecuted by military courts, deprived of the right to due process, including the right of appeal. Violent actions by military and police forces threatening peace, security and stability have increased significantly in areas where martial law has been declared.</p>
                        <p class="tbl-norm">As a member of the SAC, U Shwe Kyein is directly responsible for those repressive decisions and for serious human rights violations.</p>

As part of the coup, Vice-President Myint Swe, functioning as Acting President, declared a state of emergency on 1&nbsp;February 2021 and transferred the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the state to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

The military forces and authorities operating under the control of the SAC have committed serious human rights violations since 1&nbsp;February 2021, killing civilian and unarmed protestors, restricting freedom of assembly and of expression, including by restricting internet access, and through arbitrary arrests and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup. Further, the SAC has imposed martial law in parts of the country giving the military complete authority over the specified area, including administrative, judicial and law enforcement functions. In the areas under martial law, civilians, including journalists and peaceful protesters, are prosecuted by military courts, effectively depriving them of the right to due process, including the right to an appeal. Violent action by military and police forces threatening peace, security and stability has increased significantly in areas where martial law has been declared.</p>
