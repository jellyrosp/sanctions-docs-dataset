That fraud conviction was found to be arbitrary and unfair by the European Court of Human Rights in&nbsp;2018. On&nbsp;17&nbsp;January 2021, acting on the orders of Alexander Kalashnikov, FSIN officers detained Alexei Navalny upon his arrival at Moscow airport.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Alexei Navalny’s arrest is based on a&nbsp;decision by the Khimki city court, which in turn was issued at the request of FSIN. In late December 2020, FSIN had already requested that a&nbsp;court replace Alexei Nalvany’s suspended sentence with a&nbsp;prison term. On&nbsp;17&nbsp;February 2021, the European Court of Human Rights ordered the Government of Russia to release Alexei Navalny.</p>

In his position as Prosecutor General, he supervises the Prosecutor’s Offices in the Russian Federation, the Special Prosecutor’s Offices and the Military Prosecutor’s Office. In his capacity as Prosecutor General, he is responsible for serious human rights violations, including the arbitrary detentions of protesters, and for widespread and systematic repression of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and freedom of opinion and expression.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Ahead of the 23 January 2021 protests, the Prosecutor General’s Office warned that participants would be held responsible. Moreover, the Prosecutor General’s Office demanded that the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Communications (Roskomnadzor) restrict access to opposition websites and social network accounts that contained information on planned gatherings of Alexei Navalny’s supporters. On 29 January 2021, the Prosecutor General’s Office once again demanded that Roskomnadzor restrict access to opposition websites and social network accounts, this time ahead of the pro-Navalny protests on 30 and 31 January 2021. Warnings were sent to internet companies (Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Google, Mail.ru Group). The Prosecutor General’s Office also announced that those taking part in the demonstrations would be prosecuted.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">The Prosecutor General’s Office supported the request by the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) to convert the suspended sentence imposed on Alexei Navalny in a case of alleged fraud to a prison sentence. Despite the fact that his conviction in that case had been found arbitrary and unfair by the European Court of Human Rights in 2018, Alexei Navalny was arrested upon his arrival at Moscow airport on 17 January 2021.</p>

                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Komnov is a senior officer of the Russian penitentiary system. He is Head of Moscow pre-trial detention center SIZO-5 ‘Vodnik’, where Vladimir Kara-Murza is being held.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Kara-Murza is a prominent opposition activist in Russia. Politically motivated court proceedings based on false allegations started against him in 2022 after he accused the Kremlin of committing war crimes in Ukraine and publicly condemned Russian aggression. In April 2023, he was sentenced to 25 years in a high-security prison/labour camp. The court proceedings against him targeted his activism and served as a show trial in Russia to suppress voices critical of the ruling regime in voicing opposition to the war of aggression against Ukraine. The Russian regime is using the judiciary of the country as a widespread tool in numerous serious human rights violations. The justice system is not independent and is used to systematically and severely violate the human rights of individuals opposed to the ruling regime, by violating their freedom of opinion and expression.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">The health condition of Kara-Murza has considerably deteriorated since his detention began in April 2022. Komnov is responsible for the degrading treatment of Kara-Murza as he was sent to a punishment cell in spite of a severe nerve disorder caused by two earlier poisonings.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">The ill treatment of Kara-Murza in the pre-trial detention center managed by Komnov confirms the pattern of established practice of inhumane treatment of detained opponents of the regime. He was the warden of ‘Butyrka’ pre-trial detention center at a time when unbearable conditions led to the death of anti-corruption activist Sergei Magnitsky.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Therefore, Komnov is responsible for serious human rights violations in Russia, including degrading treatment and violations of freedom of opinion and expression.</p>

                                 <p class="tbl-norm">The scale and severity of acts of sexual violence taking place in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine suggest that systematic planning has been carried out and that Russian commanders are aware of sexual violence by military personnel in Ukraine and in some cases encourage or even order it.</p>

                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Yuri Konoveev is the head of the SUS detachment and PKT punishment cells (also known as the head of the department of educational work) in the IK-3 penal colony, where he has been working since at least 2019. Alexei Navalny was placed under his authority from 25 December 2023 until his death on 16 February 2024.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">In that position, Konoveev oversaw wards responsible for Alexei Navalny’s ill-treatment and directly interacted with him at least once a month. Given his responsibility for punishment cells, he ensured that a regime of maximum possible physical isolation was inflicted on Navalny. In his role of overseeing the (re-)education of detainees, he was responsible for supporting a system built on breaking the detainees’ will, creating a feeling of complete hopelessness and inhuman living conditions. Witnesses testified that human rights violations had occurred in the context of detainees’ educational work and that torture was directly prescribed in the operational documents of the departments. Yuri Konoveev was also in charge of the investigative tests and the exercise yards where Alexei Navalny allegedly became ill. The IK-3 penal colony is known for exerting physical and psychological pressure, full isolation, torture and violence on prisoners.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Konoveev is therefore responsible for serious human rights violations in Russia, including torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the systematic violation of freedom of opinion and expression.</p>

                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Moshe Sharvit has frequently harassed Palestinians verbally and physically, demanding that they leave their homes and properties. In October 2023, that behaviour resulted in Palestinian civilians fleeing their village of Ein Shibli. He used threatening language against Palestinian men, women and children and physically attacked an elderly person. His actions include hurling stones at Palestinians and their livestock, intentionally driving into herds and cultivated fields, deploying dogs to attack Palestinians and their livestock, and physically abusing animals by using clubs and whips.</p>
                                 <p class="tbl-norm">Therefore, Moshe Sharvit is responsible for serious and systematic human rights abuses, including abuse of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental integrity. Those abuses are also of serious concern as regards the objectives of the common foreign and security policy as set out in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
