Viktor Yanukovych supported pro-Russian politicians who held public offices in occupied Crimea.

By signing the agreements, Yanukovych created favourable conditions for increasing Russia’s military presence in Ukraine and for the re-equipment and modernisation of the weapons of the Black Sea Fleet in the territory of Crimea. Subsequently, Russian weapons that were on the territory of Ukraine were used to annex the autonomous so-called ‘Republic of Crimea’ and the city of Sevastopol in 2014.; In 2023, Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigation submitted an indictment against Viktor Yanukovych on charges of treason and aiding Russia in carrying out subversive activities in Ukraine.; He considers himself as the legitimate President of Ukraine and has consistently presented a pro-Russian stance in his public interventions.
