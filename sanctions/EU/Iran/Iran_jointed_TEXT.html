He figures on the list of lawyers competent under Article&nbsp;48 of the Iranian criminal procedure code, on the basis of which the defendants of some political and security crimes are denied the choice of a lawyer during the interrogation and investigation stages by the prosecutor’s office. Former Head of the Petrol and Transport Commission of the City of Tehran. Deputy to the Prosecutor-General of Tehran for Prison Affairs during the crackdown of 2009.</p>
                           <p class="tbl-norm">In that position, he was directly responsible for many of the arrest warrants against innocent, peaceful protesters and activists. Many reports from human rights defenders show that virtually all those arrested were, on Salarkia’s instruction, held incommunicado without access to their lawyer or families, and without charge, for varying lengths of time, often in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance. Often the families of those arrested were not notified of the arrest.</p>

In addition, he played a key role in threatening and harassing the Iranian diaspora by announcing the establishment of a special court to deal specifically with Iranians who live outside the country. He also oversaw a sharp increase in the number of executions in Iran, including secret executions not announced by the government, and executions for drug-related offences.</p>

In this regard, he has personally signed off numerous death penalty sentences, contravening international standards, including stoning, executions by suspension strangulation, execution of juveniles, and public executions such as those where prisoners have been hanged from bridges in front of crowds of thousands. Therefore, he has contributed to a high number of executions. He has also permitted corporal punishment sentences such as amputations and the dripping of acid into the eyes of the convicted.

Political prisoners were denied weekly visits by relatives, which were only allowed every two&nbsp;months. During the 2009 protests, Ziaei was in charge of the Kahrizak Detention Center, where at least five detainees, who had been arrested in connection with Tehran’s 2009 mass street protests, died after being tortured. From 2017 to 2019, before taking charge of Evin Prison, Ziaei was the Director of Rajaee Shahr Prison in Karaj, west of Tehran, where there have been numerous protests by political prisoners against abuse and inhumane living conditions.</p>

                           <p class="tbl-norm">The Morality Police is part of Iran’s Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) and is a special police unit which enforces the strict dress rules for women, including compulsory wearing of a headscarf. The Morality Police has used unlawful force against women for not complying with Iranian hijab laws, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, excessive violence and torture.</p>
                           <p class="tbl-norm">On 13&nbsp;September 2022, the Morality Police arbitrarily arrested 22-year old Mahsa Amini in Tehran, allegedly for wearing a hijab improperly. She was subsequently taken to the Morality Police’s headquarters for an ‘educational and orientation class’. According to reliable reports and witnesses, she was brutally beaten and mistreated in custody, which led to her hospitalisation and to her death on 16&nbsp;September 2022. The Morality Police’s abusive behaviour is not confined to that incident and has been widely documented.</p>
                           <p class="tbl-norm">As head of the Morality Police in Tehran, Mirzaei is responsible for the Morality Police’s actions in Tehran, including in its headquarters where Amini was beaten and mistreated. He therefore bears responsibility for serious human rights violations in Iran.</p>

                           <p class="tbl-norm">That action further diminished the already very limited space for civil society actors in Iran, including human rights defenders, to gather objective information and communicate, both amongst themselves and with the outside world.</p>

IRIB’s nightly 20.30 news broadcast, which airs on Channel 2, is the country’s leading news programme and considered to be IRIB’s primary platform for implementing the agendas of security forces, including the Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS) and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Documented cases show that the 20.30 news airs forced confessions.</p>
                           <p class="tbl-norm">In his capacity as IRIB reporter, Ali Rezvani participates in interrogations leading to forced confessions, thereby directly engaging in and facilitating serious human rights violations. In his capacity as news anchor of the 20.30 news, Rezvani promotes the Iranian security forces’ agenda, which condones serious human rights violations such as torture and arbitrary arrests and detention. Rezvani also peddles propaganda against critics in order to intimidate them and to justify and encourage their ill-treatment, thereby violating their right to free expression.</p>

                           <p class="tbl-norm">As the Government of Iran’s state-run media conglomerate, IRIB has a monopoly on television and radio services in Iran and plays a central role in restricting the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and impeding the free flow of information in Iran through censorship activities. IRIB produces, sponsors, and spreads government propaganda both in Iran and internationally. Furthermore, IRIB regularly broadcasts false and baseless accusations against Iranian citizens, dual nationals, and foreigners, and uses falsified news to misinform and falsely incriminate perceived enemies of the regime. IRIB also cooperates extensively with security and intelligence agencies, including Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), to obtain and publicly disseminate forced confessions from Iranians, dual-nationals and foreign detainees. Testimonies and other evidence point to the use of torture, both physical and psychological; threats against family members; and degrading treatment to extract forced confessions. Since 2009, IRIB programmes have broadcast hundreds of forced confessions as well as defamatory content against hundreds more. IRIB uses forced confessions in particular to frame dual nationals and foreigners as spies, demonise human rights activists, and legitimise repression against religious minority groups such as the Baha’i community.</p>

                           <p class="tbl-norm">Under his responsibility, Iranian students’ education is continuously aligned to the government’s opinions and Ayatollah Chamenei’s teachings. In September and October 2022, security forces were seen taking Iranian school pupils into custody for allegedly being involved in anti-Hijab-protests. As Education Minister, Nouri is responsible for the detention of students in correctional facilities. Nouri confirmed that some school students had already been arrested. He said they were sent to ‘psychological institutions’ which hold students to ‘reform and re-educate’ them to prevent ‘anti-social’ behaviour. He added that students could only return to school after being ‘reformed.’</p>
